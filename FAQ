Our game is an exciting top-down, local multiplayer racing game for 2 players.
Race against a friend in fast-paced, high-octane battles across vibrant,
custom-designed tracks. The simple controls and fun mechanics make it easy to
pick up, but hard to put down. Compete for the best time, dodge obstacles, and
outmaneuver your opponent in this fast-paced arcade experience.

In the future, we plan to expand the game with new tracks and cars, offering
players more variety and challenges. We’ll be enhancing the physics to create a
more realistic, dynamic driving experience. Regular bug fixes will ensure
smoother gameplay, while we’re working on adding multiplayer support so you can
race against friends online. Customization will also be a key feature, with
plans to let players tweak their cars’ appearance and performance to suit their
racing style.

Additionally, we’re aiming to release the game on Steam, where it will reach a
larger community of racing enthusiasts. The game will also support gamepad
controls, allowing players to enjoy a more immersive experience. Stay tuned for
updates as we work to make our game the ultimate local racing game!
